## 1. Overview

**SSIMBaD** introduces a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of anime-style facial sketches. Unlike prior DDPM/EDM-based methods that rely on handcrafted or fixed noise schedules, SSIMBaD leverages a perceptual noise schedule grounded in **SSIM-aligned sigma-space scaling**. This design enforces **uniform perceptual degradation** throughout the diffusion process, improving both **structural fidelity** and **stylistic accuracy** in the generated outputs.

The following table compares baseline models and our proposed SSIMBaD framework under both **same-reference** and **cross-reference** settings. Metrics include **PSNR** (higher is better), **MS-SSIM** (higher is better), and **FID** (lower is better).

| Method                                    | Training         | PSNR ↑ (Same / Cross) | MS-SSIM ↑ (Same / Cross) | FID ↓ (Same / Cross) |

## 2. Key Idea

The quality of diffusion-based generation is highly sensitive to how noise levels are scheduled over time.

Existing models like DDPM and EDM use different schedules for training and inference (e.g., log(σ) vs. σ<sup>1/ρ</sup>), often leading to **perceptual mismatches** that degrade visual consistency.

To resolve this, we introduce a shared transformation ϕ: ℝ<sub>+</sub> → ℝ used **consistently** in both training and generation.  
This transformation maps the raw noise scale σ to a perceptual difficulty axis, allowing uniform degradation in image quality over time.

We select the optimal transformation ϕ\* by maximizing the linearity of SSIM degradation over a candidate set Φ:

</div>

This function achieves the best perceptual alignment, leading to **smooth and balanced degradation curves**.

> 🧞‍♂️ Think of ϕ\*(σ) as a perceptual "magic carpet ride" — smooth, stable, and optimally guided by structural similarity.

## 4. Noise Schedule Analysis

We visualize how SSIM degrades across diffusion timesteps for various noise schedules:

### SSIM Degradation Curves

## 6. Dataset

We evaluate our method on a benchmark dataset introduced by [Cao et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/...), specifically curated for reference-guided anime face colorization.

- **Dataset:** Danbooru Anime Face Dataset  
- **Train/Test Split:** 31,696 training pairs and 579 test samples  
- **Resolution:** All images are resized to 256×256 pixels  
- **Each sample includes:**
  - `I_gt`: Ground-truth RGB image
  - `I_sketch`: Corresponding edge-based sketch, generated using the XDoG filter [Winnemöller et al. 2012]
  - `I_ref`: A reference image providing color and style cues

The dataset is evaluated under two conditions:

- **Same-Reference Setting:**  
  The reference image is a spatially perturbed version of the ground-truth with the same underlying structure as `I_sketch`.

- **Cross-Reference Setting:**  
  The reference image is randomly sampled from other identities, introducing variation in color palette and facial attributes.

This dual evaluation setup allows us to measure both:
1. **Reconstruction fidelity** under ideal alignment, and  
2. **Generalization performance** under cross-domain appearance shifts.

> Note: During preprocessing, the reference image is warped from the ground truth using **TPS (Thin Plate Spline)** with **random rotation and deformation**, simulating natural variation.

## 7. Pretraining

The pretraining stage optimizes the base diffusion model using MSE loss between predicted and ground-truth RGB images, with sketch and reference inputs. It forms the foundation for perceptual finetuning.

```bash
python pretrain.py \
    --do_train True \
    --epochs 300 \
    --train_batch_size 32 \
    --inference_time_step 500 \
    --train_reference_path /data/Anime/train_data/reference/ \
    --train_condition_path /data/Anime/train_data/sketch/ \
    --gpus 0, 1
```

This is NOT a generic MSE finetuning like SSIMBaD.
It optimizes the **reverse trajectory** using perceptual noise scaling.

## 8. Finetuning (trajectory refinement)

This project supports perceptual finetuning using pre-trained diffusion weights.  
You can specify the strategy (e.g., `lpips-vgg`, `clip`, or `mse`) and resume from a checkpoint.

```bash
python finetune.py \
    --do_train True \
    --resume_from_checkpoint /path/to/checkpoint.ckpt \
    --strategy mse \
    --epochs 10 \
    --finetuning_inference_time_step 50 \
    --train_reference_path /data/Anime/train_data/reference/ \
    --train_condition_path /data/Anime/train_data/sketch/ \
    --gpus 0 1
```

## 9. Test

Model evaluation can be performed via either `pretrain.py` (for pretrained models) or `finetune.py` (for finetuned models). Currently, testing is integrated within the training scripts, but we plan to provide a **dedicated and cleaner testing interface** in a future update for ease of use and clarity. Stay tuned for a streamlined `test.py` entry point.

## 10. Implementation Details

We implement our training and evaluation pipeline using [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/), enabling modular, scalable, and reproducible experimentation.

- **Hardware:** All experiments were conducted on a single node equipped with **2× NVIDIA H100 (80GB)** GPUs.
- **Distributed Training:** We use **DDP (Distributed Data Parallel)** via `strategy="ddp_find_unused_parameters_true"` for efficient multi-GPU training.
- **Mixed Precision:** Enabled via `precision="16-mixed"` to accelerate training and reduce memory usage without sacrificing model quality.
- **Training Epochs:** Pretraining was conducted for 300 epochs using MSE loss.
- **Inference Timesteps:** Default forward process uses 500 steps unless specified otherwise.
- **Checkpointing:** Top-3 checkpoints are saved based on training loss using:
  ```python
  ModelCheckpoint(monitor="train_avg_loss", save_top_k=3, mode="min")
